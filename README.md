This is just a funny and simples code on shellscript that i did to test my skills.
It receives an extension as argument and randomly "remove" half of the files of this extension on the current directory, if an argument is not received it will "remove" half all ALL the files in the current directory. Feel free to test it with the "rm" option uncommented.
